    <p>Recently I decided to face a new career challenge. As a software engineer I was always fascinated by the unique structures of a webpage along with its elegant designs. I always believed that an honest engineer has to have an exact level of perception of however all elements of the system works. Although it's hard to be completely knowledgeble in every aspect, I believe we should strive to have a healthy degree of knowledge. And working on things is the only way to truly understand how they function. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        And with this my journey of learning React began. Before we begin, I do suggest understanding the basics of HTML and JavaScript because it will make the entire experience lot more enjoyable and easy.
    </p>
    <h3>JSX</h3>
        <p>After learning all the hooks and nooks of html, basic css and javascript, moving forward I heard about JSX.
        JSX as we know is <strong>JavaScript XML</strong>. A React Component renders everything and displays it in the browser. Up until recently, we could just return HTML, but with the advent of JSX, we can now also return HTML mixed with JavaScript. Due to internal optimizations, it is quicker than standard JavaScript.
        However we are not required to use JSX, but it makes easier to write React applications.<br />
        Some JSX benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language makes writing complex chunks of code simpler and easier. </li>
            <li>Because JSX is statically coded and generally type-safe, it facilitates React to provide more helpful error messages.</li>
            <li>If you are already comfortable with HTML, JSX will come naturally to you as well.</li>
            <li>It is faster than standard JavaScript because it makes optimizations while it converts to standard JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
    </p><br/>
    <h3><span>Now for the main part </span><strong>What is React?</strong></h3>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library build in 2013 by the Facebook development team to make user interfaces more modular (or reusable) and easier to maintain. According to React's website, it is used to "Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs."
        When you start dealing with React for the very first time, its official Documentation will be the best option for learning and support.</p>
        <br/>
    <h3>Setting Up React on your workspace</h3>
        <p>The best way to begin learning React and creating a new single-page application in React is with <strong>create-react-app.</strong>It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.</p>
    <p>
        With this you can also create basic react applications without having to code much.
